# E-Insights
Pro Esports streamers already have plenty on their hands, yet their production kits are often rudimentary at best, and it is difficult for them to analyze feedback from their viewers. 
E-Insights is designed with streamers' needs in mind, providing an live-time comment analytics dashboard utilizing sentiment analysis to create our own e-index (emotional index). We calculate metrics such as total average and moving average in live time to quantify audience engagement and perception of streaming content, allowing streamers to improve audience relations.

## Modules Required
Note: You should have node.js installed before starting
1. Go to the folder that your project is in
2. npm init
3. npm install express, socket.io, sentiment
4. node index.js
Good luck!

Note: Drawchat houses the sentiment analysis + comments platform for E-Insights
